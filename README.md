GENERATIVE TEXT MODEL 
Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
Intern Name: Gopa Sai Krishna
Intern ID: CT04DF2173
Domain: Artificial Intelligence
Duration: 4 Weeks
Mentor: Neela Santosh
Description:
As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I worked on developing a Generative Text Model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal of this task was to build a Python-based application capable of generating human-like text based on given input prompts. This task aimed to demonstrate the ability of pre-trained language models to continue, complete, or create meaningful text autonomously.Text generation is a key component of many AI applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, story generators, automatic email responders, and code generation tools. It showcases the power of deep learning in understanding and producing human language.Technologies UsedProgramming Language: Python
Library: Hugging Face TransformersModel Used: gpt2 (OpenAIâ€™s Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 Editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Development Overview:
For the implementation, I used the GPT-2 model via the Transformers library by Hugging Face. GPT-2 is a powerful transformer-based language model trained on vast amounts of internet text data, capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant sentences.
